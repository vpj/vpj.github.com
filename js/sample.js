    text = '#Using the Chrome App\n\n Click **folder icon** on the toolbar to open the folder containing images. The images in that folder can be added to wallapatta document by giing the relative path. For example, assume the image folder is ``home/mydocs/images`` and there is a file called ``logo.png`` in that folder. Click on the folder icon and select images folder. Then the image file can be referenced in wallapatta as ``images/logo.png``. <--<span>test</span>-->\n\n >>>\n  <<<\n   <i class="fa fa-4x fa-folder"></i>\n\n  Folder Icon\n\n Click **upload icon** on the toolbar to open a wallapatta document.\n\n >>>\n  <<<\n   <i class="fa fa-4x fa-upload"></i>\n\n  Upload Icon\n\n Click **download icon** on the toolbar to save an opened file.\n\n >>>\n  <<<\n   <i class="fa fa-4x fa-download"></i>\n\n  Download Icon\n\n Click **save as icon** on the toolbar to save the current document to a new file. For instance you can start off using Wallapatta by saving this sample document onto your computer by clicking the save as icon.\n\n >>>\n  <<<\n   <i class="fa fa-4x fa-save"></i>\n\n  Save As Icon\n\n Click **print icon** on the toolbar to print the document. It will ask for the page size. The width and height is the content area of a page (excluding margins). Wallapatta adds smart **page breaks** by analyzing your entire document. It minimizes ugly breaks such as breaks in the middle of paragraphs, etc.\n\n >>>\n  <<<\n   <i class="fa fa-4x fa-print"></i>\n\n  Print Icon\n\n#Reference\n\n ##Headings\n\n  Headings have the same syntax as Markdown. ``#`` for level 1 headings, ``##`` for\n  level 2 headings and so on. The content that belongs to the heading should be\n  indented.\n\n  ```\n   #Heading\n\n    Indented content\n\n ##Paragraphs\n\n  Again, similar to Markdown. Paragraphs are separated by blank lines.\n\n  ```\n   Paragraph1\n   More of paragraph1\n\n   Paragraph2\n\n ##Lists\n\n  Ordered lists begin with ``-`` while unordered lists begin with ``*``.\n  Since lists can be structured with indentations, it\'s easy to have lists\n  within lists.\n\n  ```\n   - Introduction\n   - Analyses\n\n    - Daily analysis\n    - Benford\'s law\n    - Timeseries analysis\n   - Visualizations\n\n    * Treemap\n    * Bar charts\n    * Dashboard\n\n  >>>\n   - Introduction\n   - Analyses\n\n    - Daily analysis\n    - Benford\'s law\n    - Timeseries analysis\n   - Visualizations\n\n    * Treemap\n    * Bar charts\n    * Dashboard\n\n ##Images\n\n  Images can be added with ``!``.\n\n  >>>\n   !https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/161539/screenshots/1789209/logo.png\n\n  ```\n   !https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/161539/screenshots/1789209/logo.png\n\n  Inline images can be added by surrounding the image URL with double square brackets (``[[`` and ``]]``).\n\n  ```\n   This is a sentence which contains an [[https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/161539/screenshots/1789209/logo.png]] inline image.\n\n  >>>\n   This is a sentence which contains an [[https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/161539/screenshots/1789209/logo.png]] inline image.\n\n ##Side Notes\n\n  Side notes can be added by ``>>>``. It is possible to have any other component inside side notes. The content belonging to the side note is specified via indentation.\n\n  ```\n   >>>\n    This is a **side note** containing text, a list and an image.\n\n    - One\n    - Two\n    - Three\n\n    !https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/161539/screenshots/1789209/logo.png\n\n  >>>\n   This is a **side note** containing text, a list and an image.\n\n   - One\n   - Two\n   - Three\n\n   !https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/161539/screenshots/1789209/logo.png\n\n ##Special Blocks\n\n  This is similar to block quotes in Markdown. Special blocks are specified\n  by ``+++``. The content is identified using indentation.\n\n  ```\n   +++\n    **This is a special segment.\n\n    Can have all the other things like images.\n\n    !https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/161539/screenshots/1814286/d1.png\n\n  +++\n   **This is a special segment.\n\n   Can have all the other things like images.\n\n   !https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/161539/screenshots/1814286/d1.png\n\n ##Code Blocks\n\n  Code blocks are identified by three backtick quotes (`). To enable syntax highlighting, specify the language after the three backtick quotes.\n\n  ```\n   ```javascript\n    function test() {\n         var i = 10\n    }\n\n  ```javascript\n   function test() {\n         var i = 10\n   }\n\n ##Tables\n\n  Tables can be specified with ``|||``, and cells can be separated by ``|``. The content belonging to the table are indentified through indentation. Headers can be differentiated by following any row of cells with three equal signs (``===``).\n\n  ```\n   |||\n    Header 1 | Header 2 | 3rd Header\n    ===\n    Cell 1 | Cell 2 | Third Cell\n    Cell 4 | Cell 5 | Sixth Cell\n\n  >>>\n   It\'s possible to have empty cells, have more than one header-styled row, and have spanned columns.\n\n  |||\n   Header 1 | Header 2 | 3rd Header\n   ===\n   Cell 1 | Cell 2 | Third Cell\n   Cell 4 | Cell 5 | Sixth Cell\n\n  And here\'s an example of a table with spanned columns:\n\n  ```\n   |||\n    Name | | Age\n    First | Last |\n    ===\n    Foo | Bar | 25\n    Baz | Fib | 19\n\n  |||\n   Name | | Age\n   First | Last |\n   ===\n   Foo | Bar | 25\n   Baz | Fib | 19\n\n ##HTML Blocks\n\n  HTML blocks are identified by ``<<<``.\n\n  ```\n   <<<\n    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Wallapatta <a href="http://t.co/iaPELYc7RL">http://t.co/iaPELYc7RL</a> Alternative to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/markdown?src=hash">#markdown</a> written in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/coffeescript?src=hash">#coffeescript</a></p>&mdash; Varuna Jayasiri (@vpj) <a href="https://twitter.com/vpj/status/532035802578944003">November 11, 2014</a></blockquote>\n    <script async src="http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>\n\n  Here\'s a tweet embedded with an HTML block.\n\n  <<<\n   <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Wallapatta <a href="http://t.co/iaPELYc7RL">http://t.co/iaPELYc7RL</a> Alternative to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/markdown?src=hash">#markdown</a> written in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/coffeescript?src=hash">#coffeescript</a></p>&mdash; Varuna Jayasiri (@vpj) <a href="https://twitter.com/vpj/status/532035802578944003">November 11, 2014</a></blockquote>\n   <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>\n\n  >>>\n   This won\'t work in online editor since the twitter script will not load\n\n ##Javascript Blocks\n\n  HTML blocks are identified by ``<<<js``.\n  The code is evaluated and the html code returned is rendered.\n\n  ```\n   <<<js\n    "<strong>" + (7 * 100) + "</strong>"\n  >>>\n   <<<js\n    "<strong>" + (7 * 100) + "</strong>"\n\n ##CoffeeScript Blocks\n\n  HTML blocks are identified by ``<<<coffee``.\n  The code is evaluated and the html code returned is rendered.\n\n  ```coffeescript\n   <<<coffee\n    "<strong>#{7 * 100}</strong>"\n\n  >>>\n   <<<coffee\n    "<strong>#{7 * 100}</strong>"\n\n\n ##Weya Blocks\n\n  HTML blocks are identified by ``<<<weya``.\n  The code is evaluated and the html code returned is rendered.\n\n  >>>\n   <<https://github.com/vpj/weya(Weya on Github)>>\n\n  ```coffeescript\n   <<<weya\n    G = 1.618\n    H = 13\n    order = [2, 4, 1, 0, 3]\n    heights = (H * Math.pow G, i for i in order)\n    @svg width: 250, height: 250, ->\n     @g transform: "translate(2, 154)", ->\n      for h, i in heights\n       @g ".bar", transform: "translate(#{i * 50}, 0)", ->\n        @rect y: -h * G, width: 46, height: h * G, fill: \'#4a4a4a\'\n        @rect width: 30.67, height: h,fill: \'#98ff98\'\n        @rect x: 30.67, width: 15.33, height: h, fill: \'#8bea8b\'\n\n  >>>\n   It generates the <<https://www.forestpin.com(Forestpin)>> Logo\n\n  <<<weya\n   G = 1.618\n   H = 13\n   order = [2, 4, 1, 0, 3]\n   heights = (H * Math.pow G, i for i in order)\n   @svg width: 250, height: 250, ->\n    @g transform: "translate(2, 154)", ->\n     for h, i in heights\n      @g ".bar", transform: "translate(#{i * 50}, 0)", ->\n       @rect y: -h * G, width: 46, height: h * G, fill: \'#4a4a4a\'\n       @rect width: 30.67, height: h,fill: \'#98ff98\'\n       @rect x: 30.67, width: 15.33, height: h, fill: \'#8bea8b\'\n\n ##Fullwidth Blocks\n\n  Full width blocks are identified by ``<!>``. They create content spanning the full width of the document; i.e. taking up the space reserved for sidenotes.\n\n  ```\n   <!>\n    !https://static.pexels.com/photos/6547/sky-night-space-galaxy-large.jpeg\n\n  <!>\n   !https://static.pexels.com/photos/6547/sky-night-space-galaxy-large.jpeg\n\n\n ##Bold\n\n  Text can be made bold with ``**``.\n\n  ```\n   **This is bold** and this is not.\n\n   **This entire paragraph is bold.\n   Still the same paragraph.\n\n  >>>\n   **This is bold** and this is not.\n\n   **This entire paragraph is bold.\n   Still the same paragraph.\n\n ##Italics\n\n  Text can be italicized with ``--``.\n\n  ```\n   --This is italics-- and this is not\n\n   --This entire paragraph is in italics.\n   Still the same paragraph\n\n  >>>\n   --This is in italics-- and this is not\n\n   --This entire paragraph is in italics.\n   Still the same paragraph\n\n ##Superscripts and Subscripts\n\n  Superscripts are wrapped inside ``^^ ^^`` and subscripts are wrapped inside\n  ``__ __``.\n\n\n  ```\n   * 2^^2^^ = 4\n   * CO__2__\n\n  >>>\n   * 2^^2^^ = 4\n   * CO__2__\n\n ##Inline Code\n\n  Inline code is identified by two backticks (`).\n\n  ```\n   Click ``apply`` to save changes.\n\n  >>>\n   Click ``apply`` to save changes.\n\n ##Links\n\n  Links are wrapped inside ``<< >>``.
