                <p>I started working on Sweet.js about a month ago. It is inspired by Backbone.js. Sweet.js supports HTML5 states, so that you don&#x27;t have to go through work arounds like these. Sweet.js is not a MVC framework, but it has a views similar to Backbone.js, which supports inheritance without affecting events and initializations of super classes. And it&#x27;s written in Coffeescript.</p>

                <p>We released the new version of Forestpin Enterprise last week. The new version is a complete rewrite of both the backend and UI. The backend was rewritten to be faster and to introduce a bunch of new features and analytics.

                <p>This example is a simple server which accepts connections and echos whatever data sent to the server. This example also demonstrates the use of epoll, which is efficient than poll. In epoll unlike poll all events that need to be monitored are not passed everytime the wait call is made.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Epoll uses event registration where events to be watched can be added, modified or removed. This makes it efficient when there are a large number of events to be watched.</p>
