I've been working with charts and graphs lately. Had to read a lot about visualizing data.</p>

<p>Studies of [Edward Tufte][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Tufte] is quite valuable to anyone working in presentation of informational graphics. One of the most useful concepts was the data-to-ink ratio.
<blockquote><p>A large share of ink on a graphic should present data-information, the ink changing as the data change. Data-ink is the non-erasable core of a graphic, the non-redundant ink arranged in response to variation in the numbers represented.</p><footer><strong>Tufte</strong> <cite>1983</cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://vpj.github.com/images/posts/charts2.png">
Tufte is also the inventor of [sparklines][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline]. I also came across the book [A Practical Guide to Designing with Data][http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Guide-Designing-Data/dp/0956174086] which was quite useful in designing visualizations. It covers the fundamentals of presentation of graphics, common mistakes and various chart types.</p>
