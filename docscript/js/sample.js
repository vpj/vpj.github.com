We\n  have evaluated them in terms of,\n\n   - **Reading numbers\n   - **Finding the largest and smallest\n   - **Getting an idea about the distribution\n\n  If there is only one column of numbers, the table can be sorted by that. But\n  there is a bit of a problem when there are multiple columns and you want to\n  see the relationship between two columns. In which case you will have to sort\n  by one of the columns and understand the distribution of the other column\n  relative to that.\n\n  ###Listing numbers\n\n   The simplest and often the best way is to simply list them. Right aligned\n   numbers help quick scanning and comparison.\n\n   !assets/list.png\n\n   >>>\n    --The table is sorted by the first column.\n\n    If there are very large or small numbers the reader should be able to\n    spot them quickly because the number of digits in those numbers would differ\n    from the rest.\n\n   If the reader wants to get an idea about the distribution or range of numbers\n   in a non-sorted column she will have to go through the each of the numbers.\n\n\n  ###Bars\n   Adding a bar, like in a horizontal bar chart, helps you clearly identify\n   the largest value and understand the distribution without having to\n   read through the numbers.\n\n   !assets/bars.png\n\n   >>>\n    --The length of the green bars is proportional to the value in the list.\n\n    Less prominent color choice for the bars would minimize the distraction.\n\n   The bars take up a lot of space - at least another column. Displaying text\n   over bars reduces the space, but it makes it lot harder to read the numbers.\n\n   !assets/bars-text.png\n\n   >>>\n    It would be even more distracting if the numbers were right aligned.\n\n  ###Underline\n\n   A thin line underneath the numbers instead of the bars can give\n   a visual indication of the values, without taking much space.\n\n   !assets/underline.png\n\n   >>>\n    --The scale of the line lengths is linear.\n\n    Larger and smaller numbers of the second column can be identified without\n    reading numbers. It takes a lot less time to understand the distribution and\n    any outliers can be spotted easily.\n\n   Right aligning the bars eliminated minimizes clutter. A subtle line color\n   and/or thinner lines will help reduce distraction even more.\n\n   The distribution of numbers can be identified even when viewing from a\n   distance or with a **blurry** vision.\n\n   >>>\n    !assets/blur.png\n\n    --A blurred copy of the table\n\n   The scale of the lines could be linear or logarithmic depending on the\n   distribution of the numbers. For better understanding, a small axis could be\n   placed at the column headings.';
