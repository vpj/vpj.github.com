      <div class='wallapatta-code'>///People who are really serious about software should at least write their own libraries

We have been using a lot of tools and libraries in our software, and have replaced a number of them with our code. Libraries makes it easy to get things done, and to ship early. But from my experience, having a third-party library or a tool dominate a core part of your software is not a good idea.

+++
 People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.

 **- Alan Kay**

We have moved away from a number of libraries (and frameworks and platforms) over the last couple of years. This may sound like a lot of hate, but it is not so. We still love those libraries and use them on a lot of smaller projects. But when your product grows and you want to mold it the way you want, sometimes libraries stand in your way. Some of the decisions we made could be wrong because we didn't understand the library properly. But we spent a lot of time trying to stick to those libraries before replacing them.

Writing your code instead of using libraries takes a lot of weight off the product. Most of these libraries are written by really good programmers to be used in a wide range of scenarios, and there is a pretty good chance that you won't need them all. So getting inspiration from them and writing your own stuff will make the software lighter while making things work the way you want. A lot of programmers are likely to write their own code to replace libraries at some point, and that is probably why there are a number of libraries doing almost exact same thing in slightly different ways.

One of the traps you can fall into when writing our own code is that you might just end up reinventing the wheel. There is a chance that you replace a well written library with a small piece of code initially, but with time end up improving your code to do exactly the same thing the library you threw away did.

###jqPlot

 &gt;&gt;&gt;
  &lt;&lt;http://www.jqplot.com/(jqPlot)&gt;&gt;

 Our first release of &lt;&lt;http://www.forestpin.com(Forestpin)&gt;&gt; used jqPlot for most of our charts. Some not-so-ordinary visualizations were made with &lt;&lt;http://mbostock.github.io/protovis/(protovis)&gt;&gt;^^1^^. jqPlot helped us quickly develop a product (MVP) to show potential customers, but introduced a lot of constraints. We made some changes to jqPlot to customize some of the charts, but it wasn't enough. The next version of Forestpin used &lt;&lt;http://d3js.org/(d3.js)&gt;&gt; for all the visualizations^^2^^, which gave us more control. We never used jqPlot any project, thereafter.

 &gt;&gt;&gt;
  ^^1^^ Protovis was the predecessor of &lt;&lt;http://d3js.org/(d3.js)&gt;&gt;

  ^^2^^ &lt;&lt;forestpin_2014.html(Forestpin Redesign)&gt;&gt;

###Backbone.js

 &gt;&gt;&gt;
  &lt;&lt;http://backbonejs.org/(Backbone.js)&gt;&gt;

 Backbone was used at &lt;&lt;http://www.forestpin.com(Forestpin)&gt;&gt; as well as at &lt;&lt;http://www.nearby.lk/(nearby.lk)&gt;&gt;. What triggered us to code a replacement for Backbone was that it didn't save states in HTML5 history^^3^^. We weren't using most of the features of Backbone too, so the replacement, &lt;&lt;https://github.com/vpj/sweet(Sweet.js)&gt;&gt;, was much simpler. We plan on making Sweet.js independent from jQuery and Underscore.js, and also renaming it so that it doesn't get confused with &lt;&lt;http://sweetjs.org/(Mozilla's Sweet.js)&gt;&gt;.

 &gt;&gt;&gt;
  ^^3^^ &lt;&lt;http://chrisawren.com/posts/Implementing-microstates-in-Backbone-js(Implementing microstates in Backbone.js)&gt;&gt;

###Database
Forestpin Enterprise used a custom in-memory data store built ground up at Forestpin from the early days. The data store was a core part of the Forestpin product, and we gained a lot of performance by doing most of the calculations within the database itself.

###jQuery Mobile

 &gt;&gt;&gt;
  &lt;&lt;http://jquerymobile.com/(jQuery Mobile)&gt;&gt;

 &lt;&lt;http://www.nearby.lk/(nearby.lk)&gt;&gt; decided to drop jQuery mobile after an year with it. Adopting jQuery mobile was a bad decision. It was very heavy^^4^^ and was not developed to be used for apps like nearby.lk. jQuery mobile is super easy to be implemented for a web site with server generated HTML pages, but ours had a lot of dynamically generated pages and we spent quite sometime getting jQuery mobile to work.

 &gt;&gt;&gt;
  ^^4^^ Newer versions on jQuery Mobile seem to be lighter

###Google App Engine

 &gt;&gt;&gt;
  &lt;&lt;https://developers.google.com/appengine/(Google App Engine])&gt;&gt;

 &lt;&lt;http://www.nearby.lk/(nearby.lk)&gt;&gt; was hosted on Google App engine for an year and a half and we moved to Amazon^^5^^.

 &gt;&gt;&gt;
  ^^5^^ &lt;&lt;app_engine.html(Moving from Google App Engine to Amazon EC2)&gt;&gt;

###d3.js

 &gt;&gt;&gt;
  &lt;&lt;http://d3js.org/(d3.js)&gt;&gt;

 At Forestpin, we use d3 for all our visualizations and some tables - whenever data is connected to the DOM. We also introduced &lt;&lt;d3_helpers.html(CoffeeScript helpers)&gt;&gt; to simplify D3.js DOM manipulation code.

 We came across some requirements which were hard to tackle with D3.js. One was adding DOM elements progressively. For example, when you are drawing a matrix with a large number of small rectangles. if you draw all if it at once, the user will see nothing for a while and everything will appear at once. But it would have been more user friendly, if elements were added progressively. Then the user will see sets of rectangles appearing in short intervals, as if it was an intended animation. The total time for all rectangles to appear might be slightly longer, but the user will feel otherwise. We couldn't find a neat way to do this with D3.js.

 Another problem was that we couldn't move a particular DOM element across parent elements easily. For instance, if you want to show controls like the action links beneath the focused tweet in the twitter timeline, you should either have hidden action links on each tweet. or redraw action links when the focus changes, or have the action links on a different layer and move it. The first two options are not efficient and the third is tricky. The easiest is to have a DOM element removed and inserted to the focused tweet when the focus changes. This option, although probably not as efficient as the third option, is simpler and faster than the first two^^6^^.

 &gt;&gt;&gt;
  ^^6^^ &lt;&lt;http://jsperf.com/moving-children/2(jsPerf)&gt;&gt;

 There were a few similar issues so we thought of going for native Javascript code for DOM manipulation, and wrote a small library with an interface similar to  &lt;&lt;d3_helpers.html(CoffeeScript helpers for d3.js)&gt;&gt;. We will continue to use D3.js for scales, csv parsing, etc.

###jQuery

 jQuery is used for selectors, events and Ajax. The dependency on jQuery is becoming less and less. Using pure Javascript is not that complicated and it is much faster^^7^^.

 &gt;&gt;&gt;
  &lt;&lt;http://vanilla-js.com/(VanillaJS)&gt;&gt;

Although we've been moving away from a lot of libraries and tools, there is still a number of libraries we use. We use them because they make the development process easier, but only as long as they don't constraint us from building what we want to build.</div>

  **&lt;&lt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7036205(Hacker News discussion)&gt;&gt;

&lt;&lt;http://www.nearby.lk(nearby.lk)&gt;&gt; stopped advertising on Facebook to get Facebook "likes", because we felt that it was a giant fruitless scheme of making Facebook rich. Most of the "likes" on Facebook are useless, they are basically random clicks, which adds no value to anybody, and you need to pay Facebook for that. By the way, this may not be the case with advertising for *Clicks to Website*, *Website Conversions*, etc. - I don't have experience with those.

&lt;&lt;https://www.facebook.com/www.nearby.lk(We got on Facebook)&gt;&gt; when one of our employees created a fan page for the company, which we later made our official page. Facebook advertising was important for us to get awareness and to build reputation - so that our clients know we are popular because a lot of people like us on Facebook.

It didn't take us long to realize that the first goal is never met because we got almost no traffic to &lt;&lt;http://www.nearby.lk(nearby.lk&gt;&gt; from Facebook; it was way lower than the number of likes we were getting. What we expected was the other way around - lots people visiting the site and a few "liking" us. **"Like" never meant like, it meant click.** People who "liked" probably didn't even know what they clicked, so it didn't do any marketing for us. Also, more "likes" didn't mean that there was a large set of users who would see our updates, since most of these people have liked hundreds of pages.

Our second goal, building a reputation, a public available figure to show we are popular, was met. And it still works, because most people don't know how Facebook "likes" work. **They believe we have a lot of likes because we have a great product and people like it. But there's absolutely no dwirelationship between the two.**

State Department has spent $630,000 on Facebook^^1, 2^^.

  "Many in the bureau criticize the advertising campaigns as ‘buying fans' who may have once clicked on an ad or ‘liked' a photo but have no real interest in the topic and have never engaged further," reads the Inspector General report.


--At least they got their "likes" from homeland.

When we launched a prototype &lt;&lt;http://www.nearby.in(nearby.in)&gt;&gt; with attractions in India, we advertised on Facebook targeting India. With a bit of research while doing that, we realized how most companies in Sri Lanka, which has almost nothing to do with foreign countries, get Facebook likes from countries other than Sri Lanka. They simply advertise targeting other countries, especially developing countries with large populations. And it is cheaper.

 &gt;&gt;&gt;
  We didn't work on &lt;&lt;http://www.nearby.in(nearby.in)&gt;&gt; after launch, it still running our old system.

For instance the page &lt;&lt;https://www.facebook.com/FYI.SriLanka(FYI - Sri Lanka Mobile Directory)&gt;&gt; probably, as its name implies, has nothing to do with Turkey.

Not all companies are stupid enough to let others see their likes are useless. They spread it among a number of countries, while putting a little extra advertising in homeland, so that the most popular country remains to be homeland. To see how they do it you need to go create an ad yourself.

 &gt;&gt;&gt;
  I'm not sure how accurate the figures provided by Facebook are, but I'm guessing it should be at least approximately correct.*

!http://vpj.github.io/images/posts/fb/ad.png

So it's all about a race to get more --likes--, not creating a product that people --like--. And since these are not genuine likes, number of likes in Facebook becomes just a figure of how much money you can waste on Facebook; that is exchanging your money for Facebook "likes" which has no meaning.

&lt;&lt;https://github.com/vpj/FP(fp.js)&gt;&gt; is a tiny library to help keep &lt;&lt;http://d3js.org/(d3.js)&gt;&gt; dom manipulation code clean.

&gt;&gt;&gt;
 **Update (December 29, 2013)

 Upgraded to support the format at the bottom. Check out &lt;&lt;http://bl.ocks.org/vpj/8168794(this)&gt;&gt; rewrite of the d3.js &lt;&lt;http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3887051(Grouped Bar Chart Example)&gt;&gt; using fp.js.

I write a lot of d3.js code and most dom manipulation code got complicated and hard to maintain. With fp.js attributes, styles and events can be set easily. But the most important fact is that FP.js lets you maintain indentation in coffescript code that matches the dom structure.

```coffeescript
 numbers = [5, 3, 23, 6, 7, 0, 1, 25, 11, 19, 20]
 chartHeight = 300

 chart = d3.select("body")
  .append("svg")
  .attr("width", "100%")
  .attr("height", "100%")

 bars = chart.selectAll("g.bar").data(numbers).enter()
  .append("g")
  .attr("class", "bar")

 bars.append("rect")
  .attr("y", (d) -&gt; chartHeight - d * 10)
  .attr("x", (d, i) -&gt; i * 20)
  .attr("width", 20)
  .attr("height", (d) -&gt; d * 10)

 bars.append("line")
  .attr("class", "budget")
  .attr("y1", (d) -&gt; chartHeight - d * 9)
  .attr("y2", (d) -&gt; chartHeight - d * 9)
  .attr("x1", (d, i) -&gt; i * 20)
  .attr("x2", (d, i) -&gt; i * 20 + 20)
  .attr("stroke", (d) -&gt; if d &lt; 20 then "white" else "#aaa")

Above is plain code to draw a simple bar chart with d3.js, and below is the code with FP.js.

```coffeescript
 numbers = [5, 3, 23, 6, 7, 0, 1, 25, 11, 19, 20]
 chartHeight = 300

 FP d3, 'select', 'body', -&gt;
  FP @, 'svg', width: "100%", height: "100%", -&gt;
    FP @, 'selectAll', 'g.bar', -&gt;
     FP @, 'data', numbers, -&gt;
      FP @, 'enter', -&gt;
       FP @, 'g.bar', -&gt;
        FP @, 'rect',
         y: ((d) -&gt; chartHeight - d * 10)
         x: ((d, i) -&gt; i * 20)
         width: 20, height: ((d) -&gt; d * 10)
        FP @, 'line.budget',
         y1: ((d) -&gt; chartHeight - d * 9)
         y2: ((d) -&gt; chartHeight - d * 9)
         x1: ((d, i) -&gt; i * 20)
         x2: ((d, i) -&gt; i * 20 + 20)
         stroke: ((d) -&gt; if d &lt; 20 then "white" else "#aaa")

I am planning to remove the clutter of ``FP @``, so that it'll look like the following; but for that I will have to either use `with` keyword or create functions for ``select``, ``rect``, ``line``, etc, in a local context similar to &lt;&lt;https://github.com/mauricemach/coffeekup/blob/master/src/coffeekup.coffee(coffeekup)&gt;&gt;.

```coffeescript
 FP d3, -&gt;
  select 'body', -&gt;
   svg width: "100%", height: "100%", -&gt;
     selectAll 'g.bar', -&gt;
      data numbers, -&gt;
       enter -&gt;
        g '.bar', -&gt;
         rect
          y: ((d) -&gt; chartHeight - d * 10)
          x: ((d, i) -&gt; i * 20)
          width: 20, height: ((d) -&gt; d * 10)
         line '.budget',
          y1: ((d) -&gt; chartHeight - d * 9)
          y2: ((d) -&gt; chartHeight - d * 9)
          x1: ((d, i) -&gt; i * 20)
          x2: ((d, i) -&gt; i * 20 + 20)
          stroke: ((d) -&gt; if d &lt; 20 then "white" else "#aaa")

Another option is to use ``@``, which cleaner and not that messy, but code readers might get confused whether ``@`` is referring to the object you are making the call from. Also, using a one letter name such as **$** or ``_`` for fp.js will give a similar code - ``$.rect``, ``$.line``, etc.

```coffeescript
 FP d3, -&gt;
  @select 'body', -&gt;
   @svg width: "100%", height: "100%", -&gt;
     @selectAll 'g.bar', -&gt;
      @data numbers, -&gt;
       @enter -&gt;
        @g '.bar', -&gt;
         @rect
          y: ((d) -&gt; chartHeight - d * 10)
          x: ((d, i) -&gt; i * 20)
          width: 20, height: ((d) -&gt; d * 10)
         @line '.budget',
          y1: ((d) -&gt; chartHeight - d * 9)
          y2: ((d) -&gt; chartHeight - d * 9)
          x1: ((d, i) -&gt; i * 20)
          x2: ((d, i) -&gt; i * 20 + 20)
          stroke: ((d) -&gt; if d &lt; 20 then "white" else "#aaa")

      <div class='wallapatta-code'>Underline doesn't take away space in a table or a list of data and by varying the length of the underline you can help readers scan much faster and get an idea of the data and its distribution without having to read each number.

##List
 &gt;&gt;&gt;
  !img/underline/list.png(list)(50)

 The simplest and often the best way to show a list of numbesr is to simply list them.

 However, if the reader is to find the largest value she might have to go through each number, especially if all of them have the same number of digits. Sorting by the value will help, but it doesn't work if it's on a table that is sorted by some other figure.

 The line height of the list in the above figure can be reduced but a similar height can be found in most software, including spreadsheets and popular BI.

##Bars
 &gt;&gt;&gt;
  !img/underline/bars.png(bars)(70)

 Adding a bar, like a horizontal bar chart, helps you clearly identify the largest value, as well as get an understanding of the distribution without having to go through the numbers.

 But it's taking up a lot of space - at least another column width or more if you want to make it aesthetically pleasing. Another problem is that it might distract someone trying to read through the numbers; of course, choosing a more subtle color will help in that.

 Displaying text over bars reduces the space, but it makes it lot harder to read the numbers.

 &gt;&gt;&gt;
  !img/underline/bars-text.png(bars with text)(60)

##Underline
 &gt;&gt;&gt;
  !img/underline/underline-left.png(underline left)(50)

 Decreasing the height of the bar to a few pixels, or even a single pixel can still give the same effect as bars. Also, you can place them underneath the numbers so that it doesn't take up an extra column.

 Right aligning the bars takes away the cluttered feeling.  Again, choosing a more subtle color and/or reducing the thickness of the lines will help reduce the highlighting effect.

 The scale could be linear or logarithmic. A small axis could be place at the column heading to stop readers from misinterpreting.

      <div class='wallapatta-code'>///Another JS Framework
///2013-12-17

I started working on **&lt;&lt;https://github.com/vpj/sweet(Sweet.js)&gt;&gt;** about a month ago. It is inspired by &lt;&lt;http://backbonejs.org/(Backbone.js)&gt;&gt;. Sweet.js supports HTML5 states, so that you don't have to go through work arounds like &lt;&lt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6872330(these)&gt;&gt;. Sweet.js is not a MVC framework, but it has a views similar to Backbone.js, which supports inheritance without affecting events and initializations of super classes. And it's written in Coffeescript.

&gt;&gt;&gt;
 **&lt;&lt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6920522(Discuss on Hacker News)&gt;&gt;

## Router

 ```coffeescript
  class Router extends Sweet.Router
   @routes #You can add more routes from sub classes
    '': 'home'
    'search/:what': 'results'

   home: -&gt;
    View.home()

   results: (what) -&gt;
    console.log @getState() #state
    View.results(what)

  router = new Router()
  router.start pushState: true

  #Emulate browser back button
  router.back()

  #Whether we can go back without leaving the web app
  router.canBack()


## Views

 A generic form class.

 ```coffeescript
  class Form extends Sweet.View
   @events
    'click .cancel': 'cancel'
    'click .submit': 'submit'

   @initialize (options) -&gt;
    @model = options.model

  cancel: (e) -&gt;
   router.back()

 A registration form class.

 ```coffeescript
  class RegistrationForm extends Sweet.View
   #Register new events without affecting events registered in Form class
   @events
    'click .checkUsername': checkUsername

   #Both initialization functions (Form, RegistrationForm) will be called.
   @initialize (options) -&gt;
    @userType = options.userType

   submit: (e) -&gt;
    #Submit form

   checkUsername: (e) -&gt;
    #Check availability

This is a very basic library and it will not suit you if you are looking for a MVC. I'm using this in some of my projects, so I will be maintaining it.

I'm planning to remove the dependency on jQuery and use vanilla javascript.</div>

///2013-12-12

&lt;&lt;http://nearby.lk(nearby.lk)&gt;&gt; moved the servers from Google App engine to Amazon EC2 a couple of months back, and the backend is now built with nodejs with mongodb as the database.

&gt;&gt;&gt;
 **&lt;&lt;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6893495(Hacker News Discussion)&gt;&gt;

Backend does a lot of pre-computations and caching which gives slower start up times and faster response times. The migration decision was based on a number of factors such as ease of development, performance and cost. There were a bunch of disadvantages of using the app engine, a several benefits of using NodeJS and some things we miss after the migration.

## App Engine: the bad

 ### Data store operations are slow
  There were not many data store writes. Almost none on most days since data was uploaded in bulk. Still, the data store reads were significantly slow. To improve performance we kept most of the data in memory, which worked great until the web traffic and database size started growing.

 ### Too many instances
  App engine does load balancing for you. So when it feels like a single server cannot handle the load it creates multiple instances and balances the load. Although this sounds awesome, it wasn't for us. Pre-computations at start up kept the new instances busy, and app engine was creating more and more instances to handle this. Worst part is that multiple instances weren't actually required to handle the load, but App engine had a few instances running all the time, and we had to pay.

  We tried warm-up requests to keep an extra instance running, to solve the slow start up issue, but it was not of much use.

 ### Request Timeouts
  Start up pre-computations took more than the request time limit. This made us break down the start up process into smaller chunks and run each part on different requests. That is, an instance would only be ready after a couple of requests were sent to it. Breaking the start up process was a horrible coding experience, and the worst part is that the start up is taking most of it's time reading the data store - the system would start up in within a second on my computer with app engine development server.

 ### Memcache
  Memcache helped solve the start up issue a bit, but it had a stupid 1MB size limit per entry which made things really hard for the developers. Large objects had to be broken down into pieces smaller than 1MB and if one of them was removed from memcache, everything had to be recomputed. (Search index was larger than 1MB)

 ### Uploading and downloading data
  This was literally a nightmare. bulk data uploads and downloads had to be broken down into tiny chunks because of the request time limits, and there was no way to access the datastore without writing code to do it.

 ### Search API
  We HAD to use the search API for the last few months because we couldn't keep our indexes in memory, because of the start up time (discussed earlier). You might expect the search API to be super awesome because it's Google, but it was so slow. May be we didn't use the proper design, but it was the best we could find with the documentation available.

## NodeJS: the good

 ### One language
  Now the server and user interface are both in javascript, which makes it a lot easier for the developers to switch between the two.

 ### Server-side rendering
  We don't have to maintain different code to do server side rendering since we can use the same templates on both the server and client.

 ### Portable
  We can now host our servers anywhere. We are not stuck with any platform, as we were with the app engine - where we had no choice to pay more if they were to change pricing. We are currently hosted on amazon and it is running smoothly. We might switch to a larger server on amazon soon.

 ### Speed
  The start up time is much faster and requests are handled within a couple of milliseconds. We are using Nginx for all static content.

## What we miss

 ### Management Console
  Appengine had a nice management console where we could look at logs, system status etc. Now we have to do it through ssh with unix commands. Although this is not a big issue for the developers, now we can't ask someone else to check or restart the servers if needed.

 ### Ease of deployment
  With app engine, all you have to do deploy is just to run a command. We need to write a small script to do this now.

 ### Trying out new stuff
  With appengine you can easily create a new account or a new version without interfering with the main system, and do beta testing or A/B testing.

So far we are so glad that we moved away from appengine and we regret that we didn't do it sooner. Development got so much easier and now we are working on stuff that actually adds value to users than hacking the system to deal with all the constraints such as memcache limits, slow datastore reads, etc.

I wish I read one of these an year ago.
