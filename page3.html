                <p>Weya.coffee is a lightweight library with no dependencies to generate DOM elements. We developed it to replace Coffeecup as a client side template engine. Because of its simplicity and performance, we are also using Weya to replace DOM manipulation of d3.js in data visualizations.</p>

                <p>We have been using a lot of tools and libraries in our software, and have replaced a number of them with our code. Libraries makes it easy to get things done, and to ship early. But from my experience, having a third-party library or a tool dominate a core part of your software is not a good idea.</p>

                <p>nearby.lk stopped advertising on Facebook to get Facebook likes, because we felt that it was a giant fruitless scheme of making Facebook rich. Most of the likes on Facebook are useless, they are basically random clicks, which adds no value to anybody, and you need to pay Facebook for that. By the way, this may not be the case with advertising for Clicks to Website, Website Conversions, etc. - I don&#x27;t have experience with those.</p>

                <p>I started working on Sweet.js about a month ago. It is inspired by Backbone.js. Sweet.js supports HTML5 states, so that you don&#x27;t have to go through work arounds like these. Sweet.js is not a MVC framework, but it has a views similar to Backbone.js, which supports inheritance without affecting events and initializations of super classes. And it&#x27;s written in Coffeescript.</p>
