      <div class='wallapatta-code'>I came across &lt;&lt;http://jsblocks.com/(jsblock)&gt;&gt; yesterday on Hacker News. They had a nice performance comparison test case set comparing jsblocks with &lt;&lt;https://angularjs.org/(Angular)&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;https://facebook.github.io/react/(React)&gt;&gt;. It made me curious to see how the small library we use (&lt;&lt;https://github.com/vpj/weya(Weya.coffee)&gt;&gt;) compares in performance with these.

&gt;&gt;&gt;
 Weya.coffee is more of a rendering tool than a a framework. The main difference between Weya and other frameworks is that instead of writing logic inside html, markup is written in coffeescript. Weya comes with a router and a base class inspired by &lt;&lt;http://backbonejs.org/(backbone.js)&gt;&gt;.

I ran the tests on Chrome broswer on a Macbook Air (1.6Ghz i5, 2GB). I have not altered test cases provided on &lt;&lt;http://jsblocks.com/(jsblock)&gt;&gt;, and have added test cases for Weya for **Rendering** and **Syncing Changes**., The results on Safari are not accurate in --syncing-changes-- test case, because jsblock test case use ``setTimeout(0)`` to resync which is called before html is actually rendered while the Weya test case use ``requestAnimationFrame`` which waits till it's rendered.

 Here's a small screen cast of using **cellular** to transform the below report.

One of the biggest **small data** problems, is that data is structured in different ways. Some legacy systems give out reports in the formats like below.

///This is what SAP exports look like.


Getting this into a spreadsheet or a database table to analyse it is not easy. So I started a project to help transform data in various report formats into simple tables and export as comma-separated files.

The project is called **&lt;&lt;http://vpj.github.io/cellular/(cellular)&gt;&gt;**, and it is still in the early stages. I thought of writing about it to get ideas and suggestions. It has a simple user interface with the table on the left side with a sidepane on right side.

      <div class='wallapatta-code'>I just started moving my blog from &lt;&lt;http://svbtle.com(Svbtle)&gt;&gt; to a static blog generated that I created. It is based on &lt;&lt;http://vpj.github.io/wallapatta/introduction.html(Wallapatta)&gt;&gt;. I wanted to get into svbtle when &lt;&lt;http://dcurt.is/codename-svbtle(Dustin started it)&gt;&gt;, and got invite a little before they opened it to the public. And it's sad to part ways.

&gt;&gt;&gt;
 "Wallapatta" is a &lt;&lt;http://www.dwc.gov.lk/index.php/en/wildlife-news1/228-walla-patta-gyrinops-walla-the-tree-to-preserv(tree in Sri Lanka)&gt;&gt;, that contains &lt;&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agarwood(Agarwood)&gt;&gt;.



Wallapatta is a
&lt;&lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown(Markdown)&gt;&gt; like syntax that can create documents with layouts
inspired by handouts of Edward R. Tufte^^1^^. We created it to use for documents. The two great things about Wallapatta is that it creates documents with **sidenotes** and **create print frindly documents** - &lt;&lt;http://vpj.github.io/wallapatta/introduction.html(Wallapatta editor)&gt;&gt; creates print layouts with intelligent page breaks by trying not to place breaks at middle of content like most word processing software do.

  (Book design: advice and examples - edwardtufte.com)&gt;&gt;

I built in a simple blog generator into Wallapatta, for personal use. But it's super easy for anyone who wants to give it a go.

###How to start a Wallapatta blog?

 &gt;&gt;&gt;
  &lt;&lt;&lt;
   &lt;iframe src="https://ghbtns.com/github-btn.html?user=vpj&repo=wallapatta&type=star&count=true&size=large" frameborder="0" scrolling="0" width="160px" height="30px"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


 It's pretty easy.

 - **Install &lt;&lt;https://nodejs.org/(Node.js&gt;&gt;

  NPM usually comes with Node.js. Visit &lt;&lt;https://nodejs.org/&gt;&gt; and see installation instructions. It's usually a download and install, unless you want it installed through a package manager like ``brew``.

 - **Install &lt;&lt;https://www.npmjs.com/package/wallapatta(Wallapatta node odule&gt;&gt;

  Run the following command in command line.

  ```
   npm install wallapatta -g

  That's it and you have wallapatta installed.

 - **Fork the &lt;&lt;https://github.com/vpj/wallapatta-blog-boilerplate(boilerplate)&gt;&gt;

  Make a fork of the git repositors on github: &lt;&lt;https://github.com/vpj/wallapatta-blog-boilerplate&gt;&gt;

  This repo contains this blog post, and 3 empty blog posts, a configuration file and templates for blog.

  Edit ``templates/post.coffee`` to change the post template and ``templates/blog.coffee`` to change the blog template. Compile these &lt;&lt;http://coffeescript.org/(coffeescript&gt;&gt; code to javascript by running ``coffee -c *``.

  You will have to change the name of the blog, which is "Varuna Jayasiri" in the two tamplate files. And also the Google Analytics code.

  Change ``blog.yaml`` to edit blog configurations like the order of posts, post titles, dates, etc.

 - **Generate the blog

  ```
   wallapatta --blog blog.yaml --output [output_directory] --static

  The above command will create the html files on the ``output_directory`` provided. ``--static`` specifies that it should copy Wallapatta rendering tools to the folder. (You can omit this if you change the templates to get these from a CDN).

  ``blog.css`` file on the boilerplate repository contains some css. This file is used in default templates. So you need to copy them to the ``output_directory``.

 - **That is it!


###What is Wallapatta syntax?

 It looks like this.

 It uses indentation to identify what belong where. Indentation is required for specifying content for components like lists, code blocks, special blocks, etc as well. So it's more of a programmer friendly syntax. Indentation helps while working with large documents because you can do stuff like **code folding**.

 We've changed some of the syntax from Markdown; for instance, ``&lt;&lt;`` and ``&gt;&gt;`` are used for links instead of ``[]()``, because we felt that it's a little more
 intuitive due to its resemblence with HTML tags.

This is more like a tutorial on writing a simple node.js add-on to share memory among node.js processes.

One of the limitations of node.js/io.js is that they are single threaded. Only way to use multiple cores in the processor is to run multiple processes^^1^^. But then you are working on different memory spaces. So it doesn't help if you want multiple processes working on  the same memory block. This is required in memory intensive tasks that cannot be efficiently sharded.

&gt;&gt;&gt;
 ^^1^^ Node modules like &lt;&lt;http://adambom.github.io/parallel.js/(parallel.js)&gt;&gt; fork new processes when on node  and use web workers on browser.

All the source code is available in &lt;&lt;https://github.com/vpj/node_shm(Github)&gt;&gt;.

#Node addon

 You need ``node-gyp`` installed to build the node module.

 ```
  npm install node-gyp -g

 I think the node.js version matters as the addon api has changed. I was working on node --0.12.2--, when I tested this out.

 ``binding.gyp`` is required by node-gyp to build the addon.

 Then comes ``shm_addon.cpp``. This is a very basic addon that has one export ``createSHM``, which creates a shared memory block of 800,000 bytes (attaches if exists) with read & write permission to all users^^2^^.

 &gt;&gt;&gt;
  ^^2^^ ``shmget`` (&lt;&lt;http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/shmget.2.html(documentation)&gt;&gt;) allocates shared memory and ``shmat`` (&lt;&lt;http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/shmat.2.html(documentation)&gt;&gt;) attaches the shared memory block.


 Shared memory is allocated with ``shmget`` and attached to the address space of the process with ``shmat``.

 ```cpp
  shmid = shmget( key, MEM, IPC_CREAT | 0666 );
  data = (char *)shmat( shmid, NULL, 0 );

 It keeps a pointer to the memory block and returns it if ``createSHM`` is called twice by the same node.js program^^3^^. ``createSHM`` returns an ``ArrayBuffer``, initialized with the pointer to the shared memory.

 &gt;&gt;&gt;
  ^^3^^ Since the ``ArrayBuffer`` is constructed with a memory pointer, it will be ``external``. That is the memory will not be garbage collected and the addon will have to free the memory. Here's the **v8** documentation to &lt;&lt;http://bespin.cz/~ondras/html/classv8_1_1ArrayBuffer.html(ArrayBuffer)&gt;&gt;.

 ```cpp
  Local&lt;ArrayBuffer&gt; buffer = ArrayBuffer::New(isolate, (void *)data, MEM);

 The node module ``shm_addon`` is built with node-gyp with following commands.

 ```
  node-gyp configure
  node-gyp build

 The node addon will be created in ``build/Release/shm_addon.node``.

#Parent and child programs

 This is a simple counting problem to illustrate how shared memory can be used. We will populate the array of 200,000 32-bit integers with the sequence
 ``0,1,2,...998,999,0,1,2,..998,999,0,1,2,...``. So there are 200 positions with each integer between 0 and 999. Each of the child programs (workers) will count the number of occurrences of each integer between 0 and 999 by inefficiently traversing the array a 1,000 times.

 &gt;&gt;&gt;
  Shared memory limits are quite small by default. So trying to allocate a lot of shared memory will give errors. This &lt;&lt;http://seriousbirder.com/blogs/linux-understanding-shmmax-and-shmall-settings/(article)&gt;&gt; gives details on changing and viewing these settings.


 ``spawn.coffee`` is the parent program that starts the child processes. ``child.coffee`` is the child program.

 Shared memory is attached by parent program and child program by calling the node addon.

 ```coffee
  shm = require './build/Release/shm_addon'
  a = new Int32Array shm.createSHM()

 We are calculating the time taken for the child processes to count. Time it takes for processes to get spawn and exit is excluded. Therefore the child processes start counting when they receive something in the --standard input--. Number of child processes can be set with ``CHILDREN``.

 ```coffee
  process.stdin.on 'data', (msg) -&gt;
  start()

 Running ``coffee spawn.coffee`` will start processes and do the counting and show the time it took to complete.

 You can take a look at shared memory allocated by running command ``ipcs``.

      <div class='wallapatta-code'>It took &lt;&lt;http://www.forestpin.com(Forestpin)&gt;&gt; almost 2 years to get its first big customer. Making the first sale is always hard. It was a tough ride; talking to a lot of potential customers, changing product strategy from time to time, taking up classes on pitching and of course a lot of programming. We learned a lot during the process.

###Beginning
 We started off in March 2012, with a meeting of a few of guys. Some of whom believed that there is a lack of tools to find fraud and irregularities in financial transactions.

 The idea was to develop financial data analytics software to highlight anomalies.

 First couple of months were spent on research. We talked to auditors, accountants and managers to see if they had the problem we were trying to solve. We also discussed solutions they were using to solve it.

 Before starting on the product, we implemented a bunch of analyses to highlight anomalies in payments data; ran it on a large dataset and sent out compiled reports to those we talked before. We wanted to make sure that they wanted what we were building. It was quite useful since we also got feedback about other analyses they were using.

 It was around May when we first started working on the product, and it was ready by mid October, 2012. Sales agents were approached, documentation and legal documents were prepared and every thing was ready; all we needed was customers. We wanted to get first few customers in Sri Lanka before selling in US. It was easier to support clients in Sri Lanka since our developers based in Sri Lanka.

 &lt;!&gt;

###Seeking customers
 We decided to get sales through sales agents. It took us a lot of time to realize that it wouldn't work out with sales agents unless we get the first few sales ourselves. Losing a few months due to a bad decision is one of the terrible things that could happen to a start up - the finances drain away, founders get demotivated, and competition increases. Luckily, we managed to get a small manufacturing company in Sri Lanka through a contact. But we needed a few big Sri Lankan customers.

 We pitched to companies through contacts, but it was hard - mostly because we were programmers and not marketers. Also we sometimes didn't get to pitch to decision makers. Then it takes a really long time before anything happens.  Pitching without customer references made it even harder.

 We didn't know how hard to push for sales; how often to call them? should we send a reminder? Pushing too much could be annoying, whilst waiting for long could reduce interest.

 Meetings getting canceled and postponed (sometimes after you leave for the meeting) were very discouraging; perhaps because we don't come from a marketing background.

###Forestpin Lite
 One of the biggest difficulties in sales was proving that Forestpin could benefit companies. Trials weren't much useful since it needs hardware and connectors to their current databases.

 Around May - June, 2013, we developed Forestpin Lite as a standalone application to analyze small datasets. Potential customers could scan a dataset with Forestpin Lite on a laptop and get an idea of how Forestpin works. It had a limited set of features, but gave a pretty good idea of what we had to offer. This was quite useful in getting the first big sale.

 With Forestpin Lite, we approached the companies we had pitched earlier. We offered to analyze their data and give an overview. And it worked. The first company we approached (&lt;&lt;http://goo.gl/TcqxxT(Hemas Holdings)&gt;&gt;) liked it when they saw Forestpin Lite's analysis of *their data*. It pointed out areas that required attention.

###Training
 After doing a trial in August - September 2013, we offered a product training to &lt;&lt;http://goo.gl/TcqxxT(Hemas Holdings)&gt;&gt; risk team before they decided to purchase Forestpin. We believed it would help gain traction within their organization. We had to make the training useful for them even if they didn't purchase Forestpin.

 Me and Chethiya had no experience in training. We were lucky that &lt;&lt;http://almostunreal.org/(Sifaan)&gt;&gt; (a professional trainer we've known for a long time) helped us prepare and deliver the training. I believe the training was one of the key factors in getting our first sale.

###Next version of the software
 Training was in late November 2013, and we had the second version of Forestpin ready when we did the training. They seemed quite impressed with the progress we had made from the first version they saw about 9 months back.

 &lt;!&gt;
  !img/forestpin_2014/2014-timeseries-correlation.png(Timeseries Analysis - Redesign)

 All these factors helped us get the first big sale. Now it's up to us to make the existing customers really happy and look for referrals. Having a couple of reference customers helps tremendously in B2B sales.

##What we should have done differently

 - **Develop Forestpin Lite at the beginning

  We should have started with Forestpin Lite. It would have much easier to validate the idea and find a product market fit. We spent a lot of time rewriting the entire system when we moved from first version to second. We would have saved all that time and gained traction faster if we had Forestpin Lite early on.

 - **Not approach sales agents before the first few sales

  Pitching to sales agents is harder than pitching to customers when you don't have reference customers. We lost at least 6 months while we were pitching to agents. If we had more discussions with potential customers and users instead of agents we would have at least got a lot of feedback to improve the product.

 - **Get in touch with user communities

  Although we contacted a few potential customers and users at the beginning, we didn't try to get in touch with the communities of these users. We should have got involved in their communities in social media; for example, Linkedin groups for auditors, accountants and finance managers. You can definitely get good insights by discussing with these groups.

 - **Talk to a lot of companies in parallel

  We initiated discussions with a lot of companies. But we tried to engage with only one company at a time from trial stage. It is a trade off between focusing on a company or dividing our limited resources among a few companies. But waiting till you finish the engagement with one company before moving on to next can be disastrous. Also there were so many gaps and delays during the engagement which would have let us work with at least 5 companies in parallel.

 However, it wasn't that bad in our case since the first company we gave a trial decided to purchase Forestpin.

##Things we learned

 - **Lot of people can influence the buying decision

  Unlike in consumer sales, in B2B sales a lot of people influence the buying decision. They have different requirements and responsibilities. So in order to make a sale happen smoothly all these parties should be kept satisfied. I think this is more relevant when the vendor doesn't have large portfolio.

  In our case, the finance team, internal auditors or risk team, IT team and the top management were all involved in the decision making. All though it was the top management that made the final decision, it was based on inputs of other parties.

  If the finance team looks at our product as something that will put more controls on them they are not going to like it. Similarly if the auditors or IT team sees it as something that is going to increase their work load they are not going to like it either.

  So the pitch needs to show that the product will benefit the organization as well as individual teams.

 - **Sales take a long time

  It takes a really long time. Sometimes more than an year. The organizations are busy with loads of work. And different teams become available at different times.

  The implementation and adaptation can also take a lot of time. We still don't have much experience at this stage, but almost all the organizations we spoke to had ongoing software implementation project that had spanned for more than 6 months.

 - **Urgency

  Sales are going to take forever if there is no sense of urgency. We haven't figured how to tackle this.

  At a relatively smaller company, the sale happened within a couple of weeks, because they wanted their data analyze their data quickly. Perhaps they lost money due to a fraud or an inefficiency in the recent past, and wanted to make sure everything else is clean. And they wanted to do it quickly before losing any more money.

  Having a this sort of a reason to make things happen fast can be very helpful in sales. &lt;&lt;http://blog.hubspot.com/sales/create-sense-of-urgency-in-prospect-roleplay(This article by HubSpot)&gt;&gt; illustrates how you can create urgency.

Stephan Few has criticized using dark backgrounds for dashboards in his book &lt;&lt;http://www.amazon.com/Information-Dashboard-Design-At-Glance/dp/1938377001(Information Dashboard Design)&gt;&gt;, citing an image of &lt;&lt;http://roambi.com(Roambi)&gt;&gt;. By the way, Roambi later moved to a white background and then brought back the option of dark backgrounds.

 Have you noticed that many business intelligence (BI) software companies have introduced black screens as the standard for mobile devices? Is this because mobile devices work better with black screens? If you look for the research, as I have, it isn’t likely that you’ll find any.

 No one seems to question the efficacy of light backgrounds for reading text. Why the difference? Text and graphics both involve objects that are constructed of lines and filled in areas of color. Do they differ in a way that demands a different background color? I don’t think so.

In the above article he discusses arguments by vendors who use dark backgrounds. Most of the arguments he has considered are technical (battery saving, sunlight reflection) and doesn't discuss which is better if technology wasn't a constraint. I feel the discussion is biased towards light backgrounds.

The article is based on the idea that because white backgrounds are used in editors and readers for a long time, it is better to stick to it until there is solid evidence that dark backgrounds are better.

Editing and reading software use white backgrounds to mimic paper. Paper is whitish and has been there for centuries. However that was probably because of technological limitations on paper and ink colors. It was not a decision based evidence that white backgrounds are perceptually better.

Edward Tufte has brought it up in one of his discussions.

 The usual metaphor for screens (projection and computer) these days seems to be black type on a white background, that is, a paper metaphor. This sometimes results in video glare, with lots of rays coming from the background. Sometimes the old fashioned computer screen seems less tiring, showing lit-up text on a dead backround.

Then he continues to discuss why his website has a light background.
